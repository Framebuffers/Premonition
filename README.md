_You don't know you're inside the storm until you're knee deep into it._

## üìú Description
This is the source code for a game I did for the Brackey's 2024.2 Game Jam from September 2024. The code here is different than any other Vulkan desktop Godot 4.3 game, in that it includes the #79731 PR from the Godot engine project. This adds nearest neighbor scaling for 3D viewports.

I self-compiled the 4.3 codebase myself and created two templates: one for Windows and another for Linux. Both releases are [on my itch page here](https://framebuffers.itch.io/premonition).

## ü§î Why?
PR #79731 has had some activity as of late. This is a good real life test of what this code does on a fully-working released game.

## üêõ Bugs
- The routine that randomly makes things disappear is inherently broken. It's going to throw a bunch of exceptions. It's my first game, after all.
- There's collision issues on the stairs and a wall besides it. Forgot to add them.
- Audio issues. They were corrected at some point, but I never knew if it was an issue on my end or the engine's side, but it was **dangerously** ear-piercing at some point.
- Some insane inheritance issues. [This one happened to me, and here's some insight found while making this game.](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/71102#issuecomment-2369199135)

This is my first completed game, ever. Hope you like it, and find every little easter egg!
